                        <p> I like the atmosphere. Food is ok and their beers are bit hit and miss with nothing I really love.
                            Wouldn't say no to Friday evening drinks here.</p>

                        <h2>Aaron</h2>
                        <p> Attended a 4 course with beers dinner here recently. Everything was absolutely delicious. Lamb, pork,
                            goat, beef- all so tender and with succulent sauces. There was also indulgent cheeses with each
                            course and of course great beers.</p>

                        <p> Beer was good, the pricing and seating is wha you would expect in the area. The beer was quite nice,
                            however felt it very similar to other locally brewed craft beers in flavour.</p>
